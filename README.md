This repository contains the source code for the [Robust Vue.js Forms with FormKit](https://vueschool.io/courses/robust-vue-js-forms-with-formkit) course.

Forms are the core of interactive and dynamic web pages. They accept user input and must respond to that input often in real time and in a variety of ways. 

[FormKit](https://formkit.com/) is a plugin for Vue.js that addresses common form needs like validation, de-bouncing, and schema support all with an intuitive and easy to use component API.

In this course, learn how to let FormKit handle the tedious parts of form development so you can focus on business requirements and shipping robust forms!
